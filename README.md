Recombinant protein production is a significant biotechnological process as it allows researchers to produce a specific 
protein in desired quantities. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most popular heterologous expression host for the 
production of recombinant proteins due to its advantages such as low cost, high-productivity, well-characterized 
genetics, simple growth requirements and rapid growth. There are a number of factors that influence the expression 
level of a recombinant protein in E. coli which are the gene to be expressed, the expression vector, the expression host, 
and the culture condition. The major motivation to develop our database, EcoliOverExpressionDB, is to provide a 
means for researchers to quickly locate key factors in the overexpression of certain proteins. Such information would 
be a useful guide for the overexpression of similar proteins in E. coli. To the best of the present researchers' 
knowledge, in general and specifically in E. coli, EcoliOverExpressionDB is the first database of recombinant protein 
expression experiments which gathers the influential parameters on protein overexpression and the results in one 
place.
